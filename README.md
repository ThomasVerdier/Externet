# Externet
A new internet that runs like an mmorpg. Help.

I'm not a good coder, but hereby I welcome coders to work together on creating a more liquid, less 2D Internet.
I see it as a seperate application. Although I'm open minded for other thoughts.

The application is meant to create users.
Users arrive in the world of the externet.
The way it would work is biblical.
First you have nothing.
But we need to create laws.
These laws will be the laws of code.
Everyone can code themselves and their user interface.
Everyone can code the world around them.
How will it not become a mess?
By means of adding rules such as:
- one cannot ask access beyond the program
- The builder can chose wether to make his code open source or private
Meaning it cannot be taken away
- The map should be self generative + peer generative
- meaning it is endless (or near to endless)

Let us first have a conversation at the start. In this conversation we might get tasks.
Let's create the new internet.

The conversation can start at discussion
